# ECE385-final-project-WHACK_A_MOLE-PRO
A SPECIAL WHACK A MOLE WRITTEN IN FPGA
The whack a mole folder contains all the sv files but no random and mouse connection.
The part of mouse is so difficult, if some students in ZJUI learn ECE385, I suggest that do not use mouse! 
The pictures in the material folder is for free if you want to use and I will be very happy becasue it is drawn by me. hhh
